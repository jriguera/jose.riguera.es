Hello! I am a **platfom engineer** interested on **cloud platforms architecture**,
focused on maximizing automation, finding out the balance between flexibility and
security. The keys of the cloud platforms are scalability and resilience and I 
think by using modern **frameworks based on microservices approach** help me to 
overcome the challenges, providing infrastructures oriented to services.

Adaptive team player, fan of **agile** methodologies and passionate for **quality**, 
open source **free software**, I am currently working for 
[Springer Nature](https://www.springer.com) helping to build IaaS, PaaS 
solutions and implementing support services for those.

This is the place to find some information about me, know more about my work, 
[read some articles about my thoughts](/blog). Feel free to [email me](mailto:jriguera@gmail.com) 
if you'd like to get in touch or find me in the social media:
